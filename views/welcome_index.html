  <p class="px-10 pb-10 text-left">
  The best way to protect your digit assets is to run your
  <span class="font-bold text-sky-600">own exchange</span> and
  treat it like a family business. <span class="font-bold text-green-600">More than one person</span>
  is trusted with the private keys to keep the business running in the event of anyone's death.  i.e. you don't want all your stuff in a major exchange for fear of that
  entity failing, and you don't want a cold wallet with a password known only
  by one person, you want a family business that can <span class="font-bold text-black-900">keep running for generations.</span>
